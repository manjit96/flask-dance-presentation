Flask-Dance Presentation for CUS 1166

Before beginning, make sure you have access to the API of whichever application you are trying to implement with Flask-Dance.

Please make sure to watch the following YouTube videos to help familiarize yourself with Flask-Dance before beginning implementation.
Part 1 Helps with Connecting to Github and Twitter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiHVTHzIgyE
Part 2 Helps with Integrating Flask-Dance with SQL Alchemy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G44Tpi58dcc&t=1167s

Migrate db's

`flask db init`

`flask db stamp head`

`flask db migrate -m "migrate messsage"`

`flask db upgrade`

Make sure `import sqlalchemy_utils` is in script.py.mako

When watching the videos do note that some parts of code are missing from view.
I recommend the following link that helps with understanding some lines of code and the necessary aspects: 
https://flask-dance.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.1/index.html

The Flask-Dance documents should help with any questions you might have, if not, I highly recommend the following GitHub repository:
